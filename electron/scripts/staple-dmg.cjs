// Lifted from DemoDog, which solved this first.
//
// The afterSign hook notarises the *app*, which is what Gatekeeper checks once
// the app has been dragged to Applications. The disk image it arrives in is a
// separate artifact with its own signature and its own ticket, and it does not
// inherit the app's. An unstapled dmg still passes on a machine that can reach
// Apple to check, and fails on one that cannot — which is the worst kind of
// bug, because it never reproduces where it was built.
//
// This runs after every artifact is built, so it needs to pick the dmg out and
// ignore the blockmap and anything else alongside it.
//
// Stapling rewrites the file, and electron-builder has already hashed it by
// then to produce latest-mac.yml. Publishing that unchanged would advertise a
// checksum the downloaded file cannot match, and every auto-update would fail
// verification — so the update metadata is regenerated from the stapled bytes.
